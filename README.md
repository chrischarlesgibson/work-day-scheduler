Random Password Generator is an application that takes user input and generates a random password([Link to project found here](https://chrischarlesgibson.github.io/password-generator/)). The user is prompted to input what length they want their password to be. As well as whether they want it to include lowercase, uppercase, numbers and/or special characters. The user must input a length between 8 and 128 and must also pick at least one character type(lowercase, uppercase, numbers and/or special characters).

## Usage

Clicking the "generate password" button will prompt the user to start inputting their criteria.Once all criteria is answered by the user, a unique and random password matching the users criteria will appear on the screen.
